## Contributing to the osu!monthly
You want to add your section ? Just follow the steps !

You'll need :
- A code editor ([Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), etc...)
- A working installation of [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) if not confident with git. (here's a tutorial [video](https://youtu.be/77W2JSL7-r8) :D)
- A clone of this repository

Then, just modify this month's file (/news/[date]-osumonthly-[numero]). Things can get a little scary if you're new to this, but we'll review your changes.

When you're done, you can, in Github Desktop, do what we call a PR (Pull Request). It is a safe method to include your changes.

## Thanks
We'd like to thank all the people who'll contribute to this project :)
